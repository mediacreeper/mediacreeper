Visualize recent visits from media companies with MediaCreeper

== Description ==

MediaCreeper tracks visitors from media companies using the API available
from MediaCreeper.com. Visits are visualized inside the admin area with
a graph in the Dashboard Widget. Each post gets its own metabox in the
editor with information about recent visits by media companies to that post.

See [MediaCreeper.com Wiki](http://mediacreeper.com) and [MediaCreeper.com API page](http://api.mediacreeper.com) for more information
on the MediaCreeper service.
