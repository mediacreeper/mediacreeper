Visualize recent visits from media companies with MediaCreeper

== Description ==

MediaCreeper tracks visitors from media companies using the API available
from MediaCreeper.com. Visits are visualized inside the admin area with
a graph in the Dashboard Widget. Each post gets its own metabox in the
editor with information about recent visits by media companies to that post.

See [MediaCreeper.com Wiki](http://mediacreeper.com) and [MediaCreeper.com API page](http://api.mediacreeper.com) for more information
on the MediaCreeper service.

The MediaCreeper plugin for WordPress is developed on [GitHub.com/mediacreeper](http://mediacreeper.github.com/mediacreeper/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mediacreeper` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't MediaCreeper show any data? =

First, make sure your site has a MediaCreeper tracking tag somewhere in the
pages.
Version 1.1 of the MediaCreeper plugin for WordPress includes an option in
the settings panel to automatically add the tracking tag to the footer of
your pages.
Alternatively you can [add the necessary](http://mediacreeper.se/howto) code yourself to your pages.

MediaCreeper only tracks visits from [IP blocks known](http://mediacreeper.se/ipblocks) to belong to media
companies. If you're not getting any data then that is perhaps because your
blog isn't attracting any traffic from any of the tracked media companies.
